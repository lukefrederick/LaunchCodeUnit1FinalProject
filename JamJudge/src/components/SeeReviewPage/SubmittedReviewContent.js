    {albumName: "House of Sugar", artistName: "Alex G", rating: 8, reviewContent: "This album which came out in 2019 is a bit of a step away from the acoustic sound that Alex G has used in previous albums. It's an easy listen and is a new direction in Alex G's music. Look forward to seeing more out of him."},
    {albumName: "The Forever Story", artistName: "JID", rating: 9, reviewContent: "What an album. This album is artistic, creative and deep. JID gives a detailed background on his upbringing and how his birthplace, family, and experiences shaped him as a man and as a musician."}
